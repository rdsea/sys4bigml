# Slide (Link to concept/ theory) show importance 
1st slide

- Multi continiuum exploits new capabilities -> new applications -> for what -> for why -> Multi continiuum

- taxanomtie
  - capability 
  - multi continuum
    - computing -- we show
    - time -- 

- edge-cloud capability
What is the application
  - object classification
    - why it need multi continuum
      - privacy? data regulation
      - processing faster
      - potential
  - 
  - objects classification 
    - sensing capability
    - preprocessing capability
    - AI/ML capability
      - ensemble OR routing capability
      - Inference 

    - Option from LLM

  - discuss Capability and 

- we need observability
  - detect vulnerability
  - elasticity
  - explain ability if existing some asses
  - add Lava (could check again)

## Purpose of this tutorial
2nd slide
- This tutorial I tell you about the tracing
  - that is the key for vulnerability
  - explainability

# Readme

# Real tutorial
- instrumentation 
- change sth 
- 

- Purpose
  - What is the problem:
    - vulnerability
    - debug
    - issues suddenly happen

- Technique
  - Need tracing
  - Then

- How to analyze the trace for the system
  - explanability
    - which model 
    - which service flow 
    - 


# what is the problem
- rise the **problem**
  - understand - explanability
  - vulnerability - dependency - supplychain
  - causes and affects

- there are some techniques for observability
  - tracing and profiling 

- How to apply/do that 
  - instrumentation etc

- How to solve the problems
  - tutorial to demonstrate
